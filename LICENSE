The code is provided AS IS, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The authors shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or its use.
